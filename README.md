# Thinking out loud

Thinking about creating a car price comparison tool!

- crawl sites and collect data (Price, Trims, Engines, Colors& associated cost if possible)
- create data formatting service for the crawler to pass the data to
- setup front end
- set up api to expose data
- set up functionality to request quote for specified vehicle
